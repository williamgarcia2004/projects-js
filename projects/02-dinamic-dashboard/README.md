# Notice
- To use `chart.js` library (in this case) you need to install it by pnpm (you can also use npm, but pnpm is faster and more secure). If you don't have installed `npm` or `
pnpm`, you must download and install nodejs

![install nodejs](./assets/extra/install-node.png)

- After installing nodejs, by default you'll have `npm`. To install `pnpm`, use this command (`cmd`)

```
npm install -g pnpm 
```

- To use this project, you need to execute this command: 
```
pnpm add
```
